# Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in Distributed Systems

## Overview

This repository contains a centralized implementation of the algorithm described in the paper: **"Distributed Computation of Source, Target, and Mixed Strongly Connected Components in Multi-Agent Systems"**. This paper presents a method for computing the source SCCs, target SCCs, and the mixed SCCs in a distributed fashion, leveraging the decentralized nature of distributed systems to efficiently identify SCCs within large-scale graphs.

## Keywords

- Strongly connected components
- Source strongly connected components
- Target strongly connected components
- Distributed computation
- Multi-agent systems


## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NetworkX
